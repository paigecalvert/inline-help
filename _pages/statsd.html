StatsD is a network daemon used for stats aggregation. It runs on the Node.js platform and collects statistics sent over User Datagram Protocol (UDP) or Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). StatsD then sends aggregates from these statistics to one or more pluggable backend services. By adding Netuitive as one of these backend services, you can begin monitoring your StatsD data with Netuitive Cloud. For more information about StatsD, see the following [documentation](https://github.com/etsy/statsd/).
